### 1. Business Overview

>[!Â ]
>A local music store engages in selling musical instruments, accessories, and providing music lessons. It also allows customers to rent instruments for specific durations. Managing these operations manually has become cumbersome, so the store aims to implement a database system. This database must handle inventory, sales, rentals, customer information, lesson schedules, and supplier relationships. It should ensure data consistency, scalability, and ease of querying for reporting and decision-making.

### 2. Enhanced ER Diagram (ER)

The **Enhanced ER Diagram** will include:
- **Entities**: As defined above.
- **Superclass/Subclass**: `Instrument` is a superclass with subclasses `RentedInstrument` and `SoldInstrument`.
- **Multivalued Attribute**: `Customer.Phone`.
- **Composite Attribute**: `Instructor.Specialization`.
- **Relationships**:
  - Include names and multiplicity (e.g. "One customer rents many instruments.")
  - Participation and disjoints constraints for the subclasses.

### 3. Mapping EER Diagram to Relational Model

**Relational Schema**

1. **Customer**
   
```scss
CUSTOMER(CustomerID, Name, Address, Email)
CUSTOMER_PHONE(CustomerID [FK], Phone) -- Multivalued attribute
```

2. **Instrument**

```scss
INSTRUMENT(InstrumentID, Name, Type, Brand, Price)
```

3. **Subclass Mapping** (using **Class Table**)

```scss
RENTED_INSTRUMENT(InstrumentID [FK], AvailabilityStatus)
SOLD_INSTRUMENT(InstrumentID [FK], WarrantyDetails)
```

4. **Rental**

```scss
RENTAL(RentalID, InstrumentID [FK], CustomerID [FK], StartDate, EndDate, Fee)
```

5. **Sale**

```scss
SALE(SaleID, CustomerID [FK], SaleDate, TotalAmount)
```

6. **Lesson**

```scss
LESSON(LessonID, InstrumentType [FK], Schedule, InstructorID [FK])
```

7. **Instructor**

```scss
INSTRUCTOR(InstructorID, Name, ContactInfo)
SPECIALIZATION(InstructorID [FK], InstrumentType, ExpertiseLevel) -- Composite Attribute
```

8. **Supplier**

```scss
SUPPLIER(SupplierID, Name, ContactInfo)
```

9. **Accessory**

```scss
ACCESSORY(AccessoryID, InstrumentID [FK], Name, Price)
```

10. **Supplier Instrument**

```scss
SUPPLIER_INSTRUMENT(SupplierID [FK], InstrumentID [FK])
```

11. **Maintenance**

```scss
MAINTENANCE(MaintenanceID, InstrumentID [FK], MaintenanceDate, Cost, TechnicianDetails)
```

### 4. Validation and Normalization

**Functional Dependencies (FDs)**
- Example FD:
  `InstrumentID -> Type, Brand, Price`

**Assumptions for Violations**
If no violations exist, assume:
- `Instructor.Name -> Specialization`
  This creates a transitive dependency.

**Normalization Steps**
1. Identify FDs violation 3NF.
2. Decompose relations:
   - Split `INSTRUCTOR` into 
     `INSTRUCTOR(InstructorID, Name, ContactInfo)`
     and
     `SPECIALIZATION(InstructorID [FK], Specialization)`.
 3. Verify new schema is in 3NF.
